# Smart-Tag 
Smart Tag will be RFID tag that will be used as a security system like the anti-theft tags used to secure products and will also have the ability to collect taxes from the vessels similar to the FASTag that is used to make the process of toll collection easy.

Combining the abilities of both the tags, Smart Tag can easily help in identifying the friendly and non-friendly vessels which will also reduce the risk of any threats from the Indian Waters. The Buoys that will act as electromagnetic scanners will never switch off making it more difficult for any vessel to cross the borders without being noticed by the Indian Coast Guards. Adding to its security measures the system will not shut down without a password or a code. It will make the system more secure and will also reduce the risk of being attacked by hackers.

Prospective implementation requirements:- 
1) This system can be used to secure the major ports of India one by one and then can be connected to each other in different phases of the project.
2) This system can be effectively used for monitoring and controlling the increased number of cases where the Chinese Army is caught trespassing into Indian side of Pangong Tso lake. 

Relevance to Indian Navy :- 
1) The attacks similar to the one in Mumbai on 26th November,2011 can be prevented.
2) The Exclusive Economic Zone can act as a buffer zone as it extends up to 200 nautical miles off the Indian coast. 
3) Growing agitations with China in the Indian Ocean and in the Pangong Tso lake in Ladakh. 
4) Illegal trade between India and Sri Lanka should be ceased.
